You'll find various source for various projects here. These are my interests:

1) **Helping people see better** - My core interest is to help ordinary people from all walks of life understand the downstream impacts of group decisions. We live in a world of complex inter-related phenomena where side-effects often dominate over intended consequences. Can software tools help us all make better decisions together?

2) **Simulating the future** - My early 'formal training' as a developer was writing AAA video-games and it still feels like there's something very special about interactive 3d experiences. You'll see several threejs / babylon3d projects here. Also you may want to look at https://github.com/orbitalfoundation for work on an event driven declarative 3d framework.

3) **Dreaming at Scale** - Another interest is in building systems that are collaborative, multi-player and participatory. I tend to have a mental model of our communities as being something like a coral reef; or a library with skills in reserve, with emergent properties that are exercised in times of stress - resilience comes from diversity. We do each have our own dreams, and our dreams all jostle for space in this collective landscape but the net effect is hopefully wise. Here my questions are around social networks, social trust graphs and again 'seeing' each other better.
