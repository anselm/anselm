You'll find various source for various projects here. These are my interests:

1) **Helping people see better** - My main interest is to help us, as people from all walks of life, understand the downstream impacts of group decisions. We live an impossibly complex world where side-effects often dominate over our best intentions. Can software help us make better decisions?

2) **Simulating the future** - My early 'formal training' was a developer writing AAA video-games - it still feels like there's something very special about interactive 3d experiences. You'll see several threejs / babylon3d projects here. Also you may want to look at https://github.com/orbitalfoundation where I was researching event driven frameworks for immersive experiences (with a grant from Futurewei/Huawei).

3) **Dreaming at Scale** - Another interest is in building systems that are collaborative, multi-player and participatory. Our communities are like coral reefs; with emergent properties that are exercised in times of stress - resilience comes from diversity. We each have our own dreams, and our dreams all jostle for space in this collective landscape but the net effect is hopefully a communal system that enriches life. Here the question is how can we hear each other plainly, filter out noise and spam, and foster trust?
